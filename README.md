## Summary
With help of JavaScript and HTML code a webpage was designed with the required information about recent (last seven days) earthquakes, major recent earthquakes and tectonic plates visual representation as well with 3 different map styles. All the different information and styles are features that the user can decide on to visualize or not, though they complement each other rather than get in the way. So it is encourage to play with all the options and find the one that fits the best for you.
